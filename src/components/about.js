        <p>
          I am currently a fulltime student at the University of Texas at Austin
          working towards the completion of a fullstack developer bootcamp;
          graduation will commence March 2023. I reside in Austin, Texas and am
          the mother of two wonderful children. In my 'free time' I like to
          enjoy live music, martial arts, and casually playing video games.
